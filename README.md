My journey in Data Science began in 2013, shortly after graduating from Maasai Mara University with a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Statistics with Computing. What started as an academic pursuit quickly grew into a passion for uncovering insights from data and applying them to solve real-world problems. Over the years, I served in various roles as an Analyst, particularly within Kenya’s County Governments, where I contributed as a Researcher in diverse sectors including Health, Agriculture, Land and Physical Planning, Early Childhood Education, Vocational Training, and County Budgeting. These experiences showed me firsthand how data could inform policy, improve planning, and drive meaningful change in people’s lives.

In 2021, I felt a strong urge to return fully to the field that first inspired me—Machine Learning and Data Science. To sharpen my skills, I enrolled for a Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics at Strathmore University
, where I deepened my technical expertise and worked on real-life projects. One of the most impactful collaborations was between Strathmore University (https://strathmore.edu/) and the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) (https://www.icipe.org), where I applied Machine Learning techniques to transform agroforestry systems in Kenya. This work strengthened my belief in the power of Data Science to bring about tangible, positive change.

Today, I continue to build on that foundation, developing Machine Learning products and use cases that address critical challenges. My current focus includes species classification, carbon sequestration valuation, and the optimization of agroforestry systems—areas that not only advance scientific understanding but also hold the promise of improving livelihoods and supporting climate change mitigation.

For me, Data Science is more than a profession; it is a mission. I am committed to harnessing Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science to deliver inclusive solutions for Kenya’s underserved populations, especially those in rural areas who are too often overlooked
